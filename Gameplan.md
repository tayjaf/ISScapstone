- Source control learning (git)
- Read resources on gaming frameworks like Minecraft Education

- Three main areas: Theory of Successful SA programs, Planning what elements will be in the game, Programming/applying the aspects into the game
- Area 1 and 2 will likely be done in phase 1 of the project
